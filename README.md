INTRODUCTION
Being the fast and economical means of communication has prompted many to use email as the main communication medium for both official and personal purposes. However, the rapid increase
in the number of e-mail users has resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of spams in recent years. Spam mail has become an increasing menace as it increases the chances of virus threats,
communication overload, wastage of time, irritation and disturbance, etc., to the users. Hence, there is a need for developing efficient spam filters. Several classification algorithms for mining
text are being employed to classify e-mails as legitimate or otherwise. Comparison of these algorithms using some machine learning technique are to be conducted in order to determine which
algorithm is better efficient in classifying the e-mails. In this project, two algorithms classifying spam on UCI dataset, namely, Naïve Bayes and Support Vector Machine, were investigated for
their classification accuracy in the COLAB environment. The in-depth analysis of the previous studies and descriptions of two algorithms on the basis of parameters, such as ‘accuracy’,
’precision’ and ’recall’ to measure the performance of these two classification algorithms was performed and the result was analyzed. The result reveals that the Support Vector Machine (SVM)
gave the most accurate result among these two algorithms.
